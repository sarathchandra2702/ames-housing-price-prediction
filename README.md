🏡 Ames Housing Price Prediction



📌 Project Overview


This project focuses on predicting house sale prices using the Ames Housing dataset and Linear Regression with Elastic Net regularization. The goal is to build an accurate and interpretable regression model by applying proper data preprocessing, feature scaling, and hyperparameter tuning.



🎯 Objective


To develop a reliable house price prediction model that captures the relationship between property features and sale price while reducing overfitting using regularization techniques.



🧠 Model Used


--- Elastic Net Linear Regression

--- Combines L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization

--- Helps with multicollinearity and feature selection



🛠️ Workflow


--- Data loading and exploration

--- Feature selection and preprocessing

--- Train-test split

--- Feature scaling using StandardScaler

--- Model training with Elastic Net

--- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

--- Model evaluation on test data
